# General-Solution-of-M-X-N-rectangular-games
The project "General Solution of m×n Rectangular Games" focuses on developing a comprehensive solution framework for two-player zero-sum games represented by an m×n payoff matrix. In such games, one player's gain is exactly the other player's loss, and the aim is to find optimal strategies for both players.
